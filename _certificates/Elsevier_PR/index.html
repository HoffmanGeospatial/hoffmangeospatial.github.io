<p>As part of the GISP certification process, I signed my agreement to the <a href="https://www.gisci.org/ethics/code-of-ethics" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> GIS Code of Ethics </a>, which includes in Section III a provision to 
“Contribute to the Discipline to the Extent Possible – Volunteer time to professional educational and organizational efforts: local, national, or global.”
