<div class="content">
After making the hard decision to resign from my last position at NC State, I knew I was going to 
finally allow myself the time and space to recover from what could only be described as 
"Elder Millennial Burnout". The timing seemed right. 
And I had *finally* gotten myself fully moved into a home in a quiet, perhaps even sleepy, old neighborhood after close to a year 
of stressful struggling to find a place while bouncing from one long-term AirBnb to another all around the Triangle.
<br>
Thus, I prioritized mental health and wellness goals along with focusing on aspects of personal growth which I am now so very
grateful and privileged to say I have achieved. The "time out" for rest, recovery, restoration, reevaluation, and renewal 
-- especially after so many years of "running myself ragged" -- I knew would last into the new year.
<br>
But it has absolutely been worth it.<br>
I am proud of myself for it, and starting off into another decade refreshed and ready for my next chapters!

<p>Arthritis. And friends.
<br>
To make as short as I can a story that is otherwise really not short at all: 
I had first heard about GIS many many years ago from my Earth Club and Veterans Club friends as an undergrad.
The way they described it intrigued my lifelong map-loving, geography-minded, and environmentalist heart. 
So a handful of years later, when I had to transition out of working in the outdoors industries due to debilitating arthritis in my feet, 
I began to take a look at GIS and how it could potentially keep me connected to and useful in the realms I held dear, (hopefully without the insane foot pains!).
Very quickly, I fell right in love with it all and especially thanks to free online GIS learning resources such as ESRI Academy and Coursera,
I knew I had landed right where I could thrive… while staying off my feet and out of unnecessary severe pain.</p>
