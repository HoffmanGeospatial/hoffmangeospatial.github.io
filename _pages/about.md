Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
<br>
Thank you for visiting my website, where I hope you will get to learn some things about me as a Geospatial Professional.
My journey has been extraordinarily far from "linear", or traditional/conventional, and I draw a lot strengths-wise from this facet. 
<br>I am proud to be a Geospatial Data Analytics Scientist, having in 2023 earned my Master in Geospatial Information Science and Technology (MGIST) degree from the Center for Geospatial Analytics at North Carolina State University. :globe_with_meridians: :nerd_face:
<br>
I am deeply engaged by the myriad systems, applications, workflows, concepts, techniques, challenges, etc. that the GIS and Geospatial Analytics realms proffer. 
It is "never a dull moment" and that propels me. 
<br>
<br>
