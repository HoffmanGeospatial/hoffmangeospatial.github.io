Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
<br>
Thank you for visiting the second* â€’ and very different â€’ iteration of my Hoffman Geospatial website.
This one I forked, modified, customized, served, built, and deployed all in Visual Studio Code!
<br>
However, don't let that fool you: I am a Geospatial Data Scientist (& GIS nerd) at heart! :globe_with_meridians: :nerd_face:
<br>
I am deeply engaged by the myriad systems, applications, workflows, concepts, techniques, challenges, etc. that the GIS and Geospatial Analytics realm proffer. 
It is "never a dull moment" and that propels me. 
 
<br>
<br>

<span style="font-size:14px;"> *Sadly, as of this writing, all that I can access of my other professional website 
<br>is just this single, barebones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211202183343/https://www.hoffmangeospatial.com/">snapshot</a> from the Way Back Machine. </span>
