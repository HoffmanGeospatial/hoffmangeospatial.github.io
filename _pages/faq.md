#### :question: How do you account for the gap in your employment? / Why haven't you worked since October?
<div class="content">
After making the hard decision to resign from my last position at NC State, I knew I was going to 
finally allow myself the time and space to recover from what could only be described as 
"Elder Millennial Burnout". The timing seemed right. 
And I had *finally* gotten myself fully moved into a home in a quiet, perhaps even sleepy, old neighborhood after close to a year 
of stressful struggling to find a place while bouncing from one long-term AirBnb to another all around the Triangle.
<br>
Thus, I prioritized mental health and wellness goals along with focusing on aspects of personal growth which I am now so very
grateful and privileged to say I have achieved. The "time out" for rest, recovery, restoration, reevaluation, and renewal 
-- especially after so many years of "running myself ragged" -- I knew would last into the new year.
<br>
But it has absolutely been worth it.<br>
I am proud of myself for it, and starting off into another decade refreshed and ready for my next chapters!

#### :question: What do the initials C.E. stand for in your name? Common Era? Cogito Ergo?
Yes.
<br>


#### :question: How did you get into GIS/Geospatial?
<span style="font-size:12px;">[tl;dr]</span>  Arthritis. And friends.
<br>
I had first heard about GIS many many years ago from my Earth Club and Veterans Club friends as an undergrad.
The way they described it intrigued my lifelong map-loving, geography-minded, and environmentalist heart. 
So a handful of years later, when I had to transition out of working in the outdoors industries due to debilitating arthritis in my feet, 
I began to take a look at GIS and how it could potentially keep me connected to and useful in the realms I held dear, (hopefully without the insane foot pains!).
Very quickly, I fell right in love with it all and especially thanks to free online GIS learning resources such as ESRI Academy and Coursera,
I knew I had landed right where I could thrive... while staying off my feet and out of unnecessary severe pain.

#### :question: Is this not a professional <b><i>portfolio</i></b> site? Where are samples of your work?
This is the second ‒ and very different ‒ iteration of my Hoffman Geospatial website.
(This one I forked, modified, customized, served, built, and deployed all in Visual Studio Code.)
<br>Sadly, as of this writing, all that I can access of my other professional website 
is just this single, barebones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211202183343/https://www.hoffmangeospatial.com/">snapshot</a> from the Way Back Machine. However, I am working on redoing the topic tags like you see on my old site, because I enjoy "knowing how much I know"! :smiley:

#### :question: How <s>old are you</s> many years have you been alive?
I can neither confirm nor deny that I was born right around the time Geo. Orwell warned about.
